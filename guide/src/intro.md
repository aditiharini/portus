# Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of implementing a very simple congestion control algorithm in CCP and then running and debugging that implementation in an emulator.

We'll be using **Portus v0.3.3**. The first part covering algorithm implementation is agnostic to datapath, but for the second part we'll be using the **Linux Kernel datapath**. Please let us know if you run into any problems during this tutorial by submitting a GitHub issue.
